`recipe` is a bash script allowing users to manage a git repository (called a `recipe book`) of files commonly used across different projects or directories (called `recipes`). You could, for instance, add generic Dockerfile or docker-compose.yaml files to your recipe book to easily bootstrap new docker projects.

## Prerequisites

- bash 4.0 or higher
- [gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum)
- git


## ðŸ§° Installation

### Using recipe

Clone the repository in the recommended location
```bash
git clone git@github.com:alexis-moins/recipe.git ~/.recipe
```

Go into the install directory and let recipe take care of the rest!
```bash
RECIPE_INSTALL_DIR=$(pwd) ./recipe link
```

The last command creates a symbolic link to the `recipe` script in the `~/.local/bin/` directory (you can also change the link destination path). Finally, if you did not clone the repository in `~/.recipe`, run the don't forget to set the `RECIPE_INSTALL_DIR` environment variable globally afterwards!

### Manually

Clone the repository then move the [recipe](recipe) script to anywhere in your `PATH`, and ensure it is executable!

## ðŸŒ± Quick Start

After installing, you can follow these steps to quickly see how it works:

```bash
# First initialize a new recipe book
recipe init

# Or, if you already have a recipe book
recipe clone git@github.com:awesome-user/recipe-book

# You can add a recipe
recipe add Dockerfile docker/express-js

# View the list of your recipes
recipe list

# Check you recipe book at any time
recipe doctor

# Edit a recipe
recipe edit docker/express-js

# Even use a recipe in another project
recipe use docker/express-js Dockerfile

# Optionally, you can add a remote repository to sync your recipe book across devices
recipe git remote add origin git@github.com:awesome-user/recipe-book
```

## ðŸ“¦ Multiple recipe books

If you want to use multiple recipe book, you can always create aliases in your shell.
```bash
alias school-book='RECIPE_BOOK_DIR="${HOME}/school" recipe'
```

And call the recipe book this way:
```bash
school-book use javascript/singleton
```
