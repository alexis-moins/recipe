`recipe` is a bash script allowing users to manage a collection of git repositories (called a `recipe books`) of files commonly used across different projects or directories (called `recipes`). You could, for instance, add generic Dockerfile or docker-compose.yaml files to your recipe book to easily bootstrap new docker projects.

## Prerequisites

- bash 4.0 or higher
- [gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum)
- git


## ðŸ§° Installation

Clone the repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:alexis-moins/recipe.git ~/.recipe
```

Go into the install directory and execute the [install](install.sh) script:
```bash
./install.sh
```

The install script copies the `recipe` script in the `~/.local/bin` directory (you can also change the destination by passing it as an argument to the install script).

## ðŸŒ± Quick Start

After installing, you can follow these steps to quickly see how it works:

```bash
# First initialize a new recipe book
recipe book add personal

# Or, if you already have a recipe book
recipe book add personal git@github.com:alexis-moins/recipe-book.git

# Set the recipe book as the global one
recipe book global personal

# You can now add a recipe
recipe add Dockerfile docker/express-js

# View the list of your recipes
recipe list

# Edit a recipe
recipe edit docker/express-js

# Even use a recipe in another project
recipe use docker/express-js Dockerfile
```
