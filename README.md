`recipe` is a bash script allowing users to manage a git repository (called a `recipe book`) of files commonly used across different projects or directories (called `recipes`). You could, for instance, add generic Dockerfile or docker-compose.yaml files to your recipe book to easily bootstrap new docker projects.

## Prerequisites

- bash 4.0 or higher
- [gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum)
- [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd)
- [rg](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
- git


## Installation

### Using recipe

```bash
# Clone the repository in the recommended location
git clone git@github.com:alexis-moins/recipe.git ~/.recipe

# Let recipe create the symbolic link for you!
cd ~/.recipe && ./recipe link
```

The last command creates a symbolic link to the `recipe` script in the `~/.local/bin/` directory. You can also change the link destination path with the optional `path` argument.
```bash
./recipe link /usr/local/bin/
```

### Manually

Clone the repository then move the [recipe](recipe) script to `~/.local/bin/` or anywhere in your `PATH`, and ensure it is executable!

## Quick Start

After installing, you can follow these steps to quickly see how it works:

```bash
# First initialize a new recipe book
recipe init

# Or, if you already have a recipe book
recipe clone git@github.com:awesome-user/recipe-book

# You can add a recipe
recipe add docker/express-js --from Dockerfile

# View the list of your recipes
recipe list

# Check you recipe book at any time
recipe doctor

# Edit a recipe
recipe edit docker/express-js

# Even use a recipe in another project
recipe use docker/express-js --destination Dockerfile

# Optionally, you can add a remote repository to sync your recipe book across devices
recipe git remote add origin git@github.com:awesome-user/recipe-book
```
